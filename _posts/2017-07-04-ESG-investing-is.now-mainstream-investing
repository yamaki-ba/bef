ESG investment no longer requires foregoing returns as companies that manage E, S, and G well are expected to lead in overall management capabilities.

ESG investing is moving into the mainstream as investors are looking to minimize reputational and operational risk and are seeking ethical strategies without sacrificing potential returns. The issuance of Green Bonds, incorporation of ESG metrics into financial
products and company analysis, and establishment of sustainability targets are now extending active quantitative applications as well as passive index products. Increased data sources and greater transparency on ESG

Aggregate ESG metrics as well as individual metrics across the three pillars have improved over time, suggesting a positive impact from increased focus on ESG.

> Since 2016, 10% of all new ETF funds launched in the USA are ESG-themed. 

> The European region boasts the largest ESG ETF market, making up roughly half of global AUM. 

> The Global ESG themed fund industry is now $11bn with half in Europe ($5.7bn AUM), followed by the US ($3.8bn AUM) and Asian funds ($1.7bn AUM).

Across a wide set of sectors, from Tech, Autos, Utilities to Energy and Mining, companies are not just responding to ESG pressure, but are also focusing on the profit opportunities it creates, in particular with respect to the E factor.

Greater inclusion of Governance factors will gain prominence, given the current focus on gender balance.

Methods for implementing ESG vary widely as practical challenges to extracting and applying ESG signals remain significant as data sources lack frequency and reliability.

ESG investment is shifting away from exclusion only and negative screening criteria as shareholder activism and voter engagement have required a more diversified tool set.

Investors are gravitating to quantitative, datadriven and systematic approaches as divestment and significant deviation from benchmarks are not options.

ESG scoring and the adoption of ESG benchmarks represent the next phase of ESG investing.

Bizness Analytics Technologies Ltd (BATL) brings a proprietary quantitative metric that helps investors pick stocks in a responsible way, by compassing stable ESG scores, faster moving ESG data and capturing momentum in these scores.

We bring the first ESG benchmark that tracks the Emerging Markets fixed income market, integrating ethical exclusions and positive screening methodology.
